# Agent Guidance

- Review the nearest `context.md` files before working in any directory. They serve as an AI-oriented index of the codebase and summarize relationships between subsystems.
- When modifying files, update the corresponding `context.md` (in the same directory and any relevant parents) to reflect behavioral or structural changes.
- Preserve the Durable Functions analogies present in `context.md` documents when explaining new features or differences.
