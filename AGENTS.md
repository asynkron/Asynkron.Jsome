# Agent Guidance
- Always open the nearest `context.md` before working in a directory. Every folder in the repo has one and together they form an
  AI-oriented index of the codebase and the relationships between subsystems.
- When you modify or add files, update the corresponding `context.md` in that directory (and any parents whose summaries change)
  so the index stays trustworthy.
- Keep the `context.md` files accurate and conciseâ€”update descriptions and cross-links whenever functionality changes so future
  agents can trust the index.
