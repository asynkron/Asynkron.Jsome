# Agent Guidance
- Always open the nearest `context.md` before working in a directory. Every folder in the repo has one and together they form an
  AI-oriented index of the codebase and the relationships between subsystems.
- When you modify or add files, update the corresponding `context.md` in that directory (and any parents whose summaries change)
  so the index stays trustworthy.
- Preserve the Durable Functions analogies present in `context.md` documents when explaining new features or differences; extend
  them when helpful to clarify behavior changes.
