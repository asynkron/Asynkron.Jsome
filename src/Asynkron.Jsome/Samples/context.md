# Samples

Quick-start assets demonstrating generator usage:
- `petstore-swagger.json` — Canonical Swagger 2.0 example for smoke testing the generator pipeline.
- [`Configuration`](Configuration/context.md) — YAML/JSON snippets (`sample-config.yaml`, `sample-config.json`) showcasing
  modifier options such as namespace overrides, inclusion filters, and validation hints.

These samples function like Durable Functions quickstarts: ready-to-run inputs you can feed into the orchestrator (`Program.cs`)
to understand behavior before applying it to production schemas.
