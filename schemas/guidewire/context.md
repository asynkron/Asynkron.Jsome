# Guidewire Schemas

Contains `claims.json`, a representative Guidewire InsuranceSuite schema. Use it to exercise nested object graphs, enums, and validation scenarios. The structure stresses the generator's ability to handle deep property paths in `ModifierConfiguration`, similar to orchestrating complex entity graphs in Azure Durable Functions.
