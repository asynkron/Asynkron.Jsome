# Schema Catalog

Reference JSON schemas used to validate generator behavior and provide ready-made inputs for integration scenarios.

- [`guidewire`](guidewire/context.md) — Claims management schema sample.
- [`ocppv16`](ocppv16/context.md) — Open Charge Point Protocol v1.6 message schemas (dozens of request/response pairs).

These directories allow AI agents to reason about real-world payloads similarly to how Azure Durable Functions samples illustrate orchestrations across external services.
